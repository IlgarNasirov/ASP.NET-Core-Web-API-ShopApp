This is a shop web project where you can do all CRUD operations on your products. You just need to sign up and sign in for that. Unauthenticated users can just see other users' products. I used bcrypt(for hashing password), JSON Web Token(for authentication and authorization), Entity Framework Core(as ORM framework) with code first approach and Microsoft SQL Server(as database).
